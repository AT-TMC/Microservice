## Translation Microservice

### Communication Contract

This microservice provides language detection and translation functionalities. Below are the instructions on how to programmatically request and receive data.

#### Requesting Data

To request language detection or translation, call the following functions in your Python code:

- `detect_language(text)`: Pass the `text` to detect the language.
- `translate_text(text, target_language)`: Pass the `text` and `target_language` to translate the text.

Example Usage:
```python
detected_language = detect_language("Hello, how are you?")
print("Detected Language:", detected_language)

translated_text = translate_text("Hello, how are you?", "Spanish")
print("Translated Text:", translated_text)
```

#### Receiving Data

The functions will return the following:

- For `detect_language(text)`:
  - Returns: Detected language as a string.
- For `translate_text(text, target_language)`:
  - Returns: Translated text as a string.
